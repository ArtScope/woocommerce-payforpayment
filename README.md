WooCommerce Pay for Payment
===========================

About
-----
Add individual charges for each payment method as a flat rate and/or as a percentage of the cart total.
The plugin first calculates the percentage rate and then adds the fixed rate on top.
Coupons are not supported. (Sorry guys. I tried, but no way.)
